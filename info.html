        <p>Moral injury negatively influences nurse well-being, which may increase nurse burnout. Nurse leaders are acutely aware of moral injury impact; however, few studies represent the direct care nurse’s recommendations for interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted surveying direct care nurses from 7 hospitals exploring nurse moral injury and preferences for nurse well-being interventions including an open-text format. Nurses selected pet therapy (58%) and mindfulness reflection (44.3%) as priority interventions. Two core interventional themes emerged: well-being and work environment. Manageable workloads and healthy unit cultures are desired, alongside well-being interventions to mitigate moral injury.</p>
        <p>Moral injury (MI) is defined as an act that creates internal conflict because it violates assumptions and beliefs about right versus wrong.1 Individuals experiencing MI are at increased risk of depression, anxiety, and suicide.1 Since the initial global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, research has indicated that nurses felt significant levels of MI.2 Callis et al. found a significant inverse relationship between MI and nurse work performance and levels of MI were found to be a strong independent predictor of self-reported work performance.3 These were alarming findings in light of the psychological adverse effects nurses have been suffering and the potential implications for compromise in patient safety related to work performance.</p>
        <p>Current interventions targeting MI are two-fold, a combination of institutional support, such as hospital care programs for nurses and self-help related resources, although rigorous randomized-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of these interventions are limited.1 Studies to evaluate the effectiveness of well-being interventions are necessary to ensure healthy work environments, help ameliorate MI in nurses, and prevent burnout. Small scale professional interventions have been launched focusing on burnout and secondary traumatic stress.4,5 Prior to launching interventional programs, best practice requires thorough assessment of nurses’ ideas and recommendations to gauge the specific and overall needs of nurses.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Callis et al. added an open-ended inquiry as part of a cross-sectional MI survey whose purpose was to give nurses a voice in the investigation of preferred interventions that aid in the reduction of nurse-experienced MI and improve overall well-being.3 Study aims included: (a) describing the participant sample, (b) assessing proposed and suggested interventions of participating nurses, and (c) determining preferences related to interventions both in and outside of the workplace. A thorough categorization of recommended interventions detailed by study participants was also performed.</p>

    <div class="description">
        <p>Comprehensive study methods from the original publication, referred to above (moral injury and nursing work performance) have been reported.3 Direct care registered nurses in 7 hospitals across California were recruited to complete a survey in 2022 using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system.6 Following informed consent, the survey included demographic information and the Moral Injury Symptom Scale for Healthcare Professionals (MISS-HP). Nurses were also given the opportunity to indicate interest in the suggested interventions and/or provide ideas within the open-ended option. Suggested interventions included: bible study outside of work; chaplain services at work and/or outside of work; pet therapy at work and/or outside of work; guided mindfulness reflection at work and/or outside of work; and support group services outside of work. The prompt for the open-ended option was, “Please add any other interventions that you feel may have a positive impact on your well-being.” The study was approved by the health organization’s institutional review board.</p>
        <p>The MISS-HP is a valid and reliable self-reporting instrument for assessing MI symptoms in health professionals,2 and made up of 10-items evaluating betrayal, guilt, shame, moral concerns, religious struggle, loss of religious/spiritual faith, loss of meaning/purpose, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, and self-condemnation via a 10-point Likert scale. Scores range from 10 to 100 with 36 or higher identifying moderate to extreme MI-based problems such as those impacting family, social, and/or occupational functioning.</p>
        <p>Open-ended responses were evaluated using content analysis.7 The first two authors independently and collectively reviewed all responses, formed codes and relationships, and determined emerging patterns.</p>

        <p>The average age of nurses completing the survey was 42.6 years (SD = 12) and had been a nurse for 15.2 years (SD = 12.2). The majority were female (90.3%) and white (52.4%) with smaller numbers of Hispanic/Latina/o/x (16.2%) and Asian Americans (15.7%). Most worked full time (83.2%) and over half had a Bachelor’s in Nursing (66.5%) and were living with a partner (68.1%) while roughly a third had at least one child at home (34.1%). The most common religious affiliation was Christian (57.3%). Few responders reported previously diagnosed anxiety (15.7%) or depression (15.1%). The average MISS-HP score was 38.9 (SD: 14.1) and over half (56.2%) of the participants were above the 36-point level (see Table 1).</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health defines complementary as non-mainstream approaches used together with mainstream practices, and alternative as in lieu of conventional medicine.8 There were 24 different statements that recommended the use of CAM interventions including music therapy, journaling, yoga, massage, pet therapy, acupuncture, essential oils, healing touch, and mindfulness/meditation practice. Additional suggested interventions included breath work, clearing one’s mind, and reflection. Massage, yoga, and pet therapy were the most mentioned. Two participants felt that CAM interventions were not enough. “Coloring walls in the break room and telling us to practice mindfulness is not very mindful of admin to think it'll help with anything that's expected of us” and “Meditation is a wonderful tool, but it will not solve the problems we are facing.”</p>

        <p>Psychological support is defined as support that meets mental, social, emotional, and spiritual needs of the individual.9 Twenty-three participants proposed interventions such as counseling, support groups, and spiritual care. Some nurses suggested therapy, in addition to sharing that they were currently in therapy themselves. “I started talk therapy…” “Therapy through [a specific mental health service] to treat my PTSD and anxiety after dealing with COVID surges”, or “I started seeing a counselor virtually.</p>
        <p>Support groups were mentioned several times. Some referenced a debriefing-type experience such as “talking and venting with my co-workers” or “short debrief, after shift, with coworkers about certain situations and how they affected you or staff members.” Others specifically used the phrase “support groups”, for example “Support groups onsite, after work.” In addition to counseling and support groups, some nurses identified attending bible studies, church services, or meeting with the hospital-based chaplain.</p>

<p>Twenty suggestions included comments about flexible scheduling, recovery time, and adequate staffing. Most simply wrote “time off work” while others identified specific changes to the traditional nurse work schedule suggesting sabbaticals and mental health days. Examples included, “Sabbatical, unpaid approved time off, like the travelers get between assignments” and “voluntary respites or time off without penalty or use of paid time off for a ‘health day’ that does not interfere with normal work schedule.”</p>
 <p>Recovery time is defined by the authors as a reasonable amount of time for the nurse to recover during their shift. The number, duration, and adequacy of breaks were mentioned by 8 participants. Suggestions were “5 to 15 minutes at the koi pond daily x 4” or “Having an opportunity to reflect or/and deflate (2 to 5 minutes perhaps) prior to stepping back into nurse mode.” Multiple participants suggested interventions including more appropriate, improved, and safe staffing.</p>

Nurses were left for slaughter, and it continues.” Some nurses expressed wanting “words of encouragement from nurse leaders” or “check-ins with management weekly.” More specific interventions to improve unit culture included team building activities, promoting opportunities to explore other specialties, and having designated time and support to pursue advanced education.</p>

<p>Nine comments offered unique strategies including hazard pay, pay raises, and retention bonuses. Participating nurses also identified specific incentives they would be interested in like “vouchers for self-care outside of work. Like a voucher for a massage”, “Rewards/discounts or other benefits for participating in a consistent exercise program”, or “Free memberships to the gym.”</p>

    <p>Moral injury measured by MISS-HP was high; the average score was approximately 36 with most participants scoring slightly higher. This indicates that interventions to ameliorate MI and support nurses’ well-being are needed. Proposed interventions at work were selected significantly more often than those outside of work in all 3 core interventional themes indicating nurses are requiring more effective support within their work environment.</p>
    <p>Pet therapy, the most popular CAM intervention selected by study participants to promote well-being is not a new idea. In 1962, child psychiatrist, Dr. Boris Levinson, began documenting his use of pet therapy for patients.10 Clark (2022) conducted a qualitative study revealing that nurses perceived pet therapy as decreasing their occupational stress.11 Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) could be as simple as encouraging service animals visiting patients to stop by the nurse’s station.</p>
    <p>In a systemic review, Sulosaari et al. (2022) found that 10 of the 11 studies demonstrated a positive impact of mindfulness-based interventions on nurses' psychological well-being.12 Several studies support mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) as an effective stress reduction strategy that promotes well-being.13,14 However, effective types of mindfulness-based interventions need further testing to ensure effectiveness for ameliorating MI.</p>
    <p>Approximately one third of the participants acknowledged chaplains as a successful intervention. Care programs for nurses, such as Tea for the Soul (TFS), are on the rise and becoming increasingly more effective.15 TFS provides a venue whereby nurses can pause and receive spiritual and/or inspiration support. A chaplain or social worker may provide the nurse with refreshments and some moments for reflection. Through the ministry of presence, someone showing compassion to the nurse for the work they do, can facilitate them returning to care for others feeling rejuvenated. TFS also incorporates a debriefing aspect, which is one competent in this study that nurses were requesting.</p>
    <p>Holistic approaches in the workplace that provide psychological support and promote nurse well-being are being explored. Serenity and Lavender lounges, that may include massage equipment, provide designated spaces for nurses to take breaks for the purpose of relaxation and building resilience. However, while much of the research on the use of serenity rooms has been positive,16 obstacles include the practicality of nurses taking time out from a busy workload to meet their own needs.17,18</p>
    <p>Well-being interventions, conducted in the workplace need to be in combination with work environment interventions. Although personal well-being is important, environmental modifications must be implemented. The themes found in this study: Manageable Workloads and Scheduling, Unit Culture and Leadership, and Incentives and Compensation serve as recommendations for work environment strategies.</p>
    <p>What was most surprising is that compensation was the least requested intervention. Nurses felt that having a manageable workload with appropriate recovery times (meaningful breaks) was a top priority. This can be tied to interventions such as providing a “Zen-den” or having regularly scheduled TFS debriefing opportunities. Additionally, nurses recommended that break nurses have the sole responsibility of caring for the patients assigned to the nurse on break, without having their own patient assignment.</p>
    <p>Nurses also need a healthy unit culture and strong transformational leaders who affirm that the voice of the nurse is heard and that measures are underway to improve work environments. This study provides additional data to largely confirm what is found in the literature and serves to act as an impetus to further evaluate interventions that effectively decrease MI in nurses, promote nurse well-being, and ultimately optimize patient care outcomes.</p>

    <div class="description">
<p>This study illustrates the voice of the nurse and articulates nursing's requested interventions regarding nurse well-being. Interventions such as pet therapy, mindfulness, and chaplaincy support may directly improve the nurse's well-being. Work environment interventions directly impact the nurse by creating a culture whereby nurses can thrive. Well-being and work environment interventions should be considered when strategizing and prioritizing nurse well-being initiatives.</p>
